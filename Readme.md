# üöÄ Space Portfolio ‚Äì Tanaka Danny Chijaka

**Finally finished!** This is my interactive, 3D space-themed portfolio. Each planet in the solar system represents a section of my journey‚ÄîAbout Me, Skills, Projects, Education, Experience, Certifications, and Contact. Click a planet to explore its own animated space environment, complete with rotating planets, shooting stars, and floating debris.
